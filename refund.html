            <p>At Infinity Retouch, we want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. However, because our products are digital software delivered via Internet download, we generally offer refunds on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <h2>1. 7-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
            <p>We offer a full refund within <strong>7 days of your purchase</strong> if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The software is technically incompatible with your system (Adobe Photoshop CC 2023+ on Windows or Mac).</li>
                <li>The software fails to function as described, and our support team cannot resolve the issue.</li>
                <li>You purchased the product by mistake and have not activated the license key.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Non-Refundable Circumstances</h2>
            <p>We may decline refund requests if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>More than 7 days have passed since the purchase.</li>
                <li>The license key has been activated and used extensively.</li>
                <li>The refund is requested due to a change of mind after successful use.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How to Request a Refund</h2>
